# Littoral-pelagic-C-transport
These scripts show the transport models used to calculate the transport of CH4 and CO2 from the vegetated littoral to the pelagic zone.

-"CH4_global_model.R" 
-"CO2_global_model.R", for lakes with pH <7.2 

The two simulations use the support functions in the file "Support_functions.R" and the file "global.vegetation.cover.csv" as input.
